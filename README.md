# Case-Study-CE880

This study is to determine the impact of EDA and feature engineering on the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in predicting whether a booking will be cancelled based on available data

The code involved the following steps:

  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  Training Model
  
The file name of is CE880_Project with the extension ipynb.
The dataset used is the 'hotel booking' data.
Run the file on Google colab and run each cell one by one.
The data is stored as a csv file in this repository. The repository is cloned and the dataset is imported onto the notebook.
